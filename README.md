The Caesar Cipher is a simple encryption technique that replaces each letter in a message with a letter a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. This shift value, known as the key, is chosen by the user and can range from 1 to 25. Each letter in the plaintext message is converted to its corresponding alphabetical index, and then the key is added to each index to get the ciphertext letter. For example, with a key of 3, the letter "H" becomes "K", "E" becomes "H", and so on. To decrypt the message, the same key is used, but the process is reversed, subtracting the key from each index to retrieve the original plaintext letters. While the Caesar Cipher is easy to implement, it's not very secure, as it can be easily broken by trying all possible keys or analyzing letter frequencies.
